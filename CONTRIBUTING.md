# Contributing to Dank Neon

So you want to create a theme or resource for Dank Neon? Well, we are happy to 
have you and want to help however we can! This doc should help you get started,
but if you have any problems, [open up an issue](https://github.com/DankNeon/meta/issues)
or join our [Spectrum Chat](https://spectrum.chat/dankneon).

## Getting Started

First things first, you are going to fork this repo. It contains a lot of the 
base files you need for your theme. 

> Speaking of those files, here is a quick description of some of the useful stuff
> in this repo.
> `demos/` - this folder contains a lot of basic files you can test your theme with
> `index.html` - this file has the base template for the individual theme on dankneon.com
> `colors.md` - this file has a table with all the color information you might need for building a Dank Neon theme
> `README.template.md` - this file contains a basic template for your README.md file - fill it out or change it however you need!

Once you have this repo forked and cloned, follow the instructions for building 
a theme with your editor. Add any files you need to add to build your theme and 
make sure to write a bit of documentation around building/installing/testing your
theme so others can help you work! We at least expect a CONTRIBUTING.md file with
the basics, a README.md so that people know what the repo is about, and a copy of
our CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

**Note:** If your theme has a central package repository, like VS Code or Sublime
we ask that you let us post the package, so it has the official information from Dank Neon.
